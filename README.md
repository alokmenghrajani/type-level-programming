# Type Level Programming

## One
This repo contains properly commented code for the "Type Level Programming"
[PagedOut!](https://pagedout.institute/) article.

The code will only type check if the `MagicSquare` types contain a
magic square array. A magic square is a grid of numbers where the columns, rows,
and both main diagonals all have the same sum. In addition, all elements must
be different.

You can run the typechecker with:

```bash
cd one/
npm install
npm run tsc
```
